# Pigs in Space VSCode Theme

A dark Visual Studio Code theme that's easy on the eyes. Inspired by Solarized and Twilight, it's low-contrast with pastel colors so you can work all day without eye strain. Looks best with the [Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/) font.
